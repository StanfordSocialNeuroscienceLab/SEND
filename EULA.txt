User may not distribute the Dataset or portions thereof to other individuals who have not accepted the license agreement or the general public, with the exception of using screenshots or short segments for the sole purpose of clarifications in academic publications or presentations. 

2. Commercial use. User may use the Dataset only for academic research. User may not use the Dataset for any commercial purposes, or for any research that directly leads to commercial purposes. Commercial purposes include, but are not limited to:

        b. Using screenshots of participants in the Dataset for advertisements
        c. Selling data from the Dataset
        d. Creating military applications
        e. Creating surveillance applications

3. Computer Generated Media. User is not allowed to synthesize and/or modify audio-realistic and/or video-realistic representations (indistinguishable from photo/video recordings) of the individuals in this Dataset. This includes synthesizing videos and/or audio of individuals telling modified or novel stories, or synthesizing the likeness of individuals in this Dataset performing actions not present in this Dataset ("deep fakes").
